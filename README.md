# Project Assignment (DO NOT MERGE WITHOUT REVIEW) 

## Use materializeCSS throughout the project. Make sure you use these links while making the templates.
# IT IS ESSENTIAL YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN s6 and m6 col widths
## Note that the page is divided into a container, which is then divided into 12-columns
## s12 => On a small (mobile) display, the content will be full width (12 of 12)
## m6 => On a medium (laptop) display, the content will be half width (6 of 12)
## Use offset-m<x> to move a div by x units in the specified display size

Use materializeCSS throughout the project. Make sure you use these links while making the templates.
Copy the ` template.html ` onto your PC and work in it to have less issues later on. DO NOT MAKE CHANGES outside of the container
